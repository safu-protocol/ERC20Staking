# ERC20Staking Smart Contract with Dynamic Rewards
### A fixed amount of rewards is distributed in a period chosen by the Owner of the contract. Users can stake their LP Tokens to get ERC20 Token rewards. For each second of that period, there is a Tokens per Second value(Total rewards distributed devided by seconds in the Staking period), that is split between the Users that stake in the said second and each user is allocated tokens based on their stake's share of the total amount of LP Tokens staked.

#### Created using the Synthetix [Staking Rewards](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/blob/v2.76.0-alpha/contracts/StakingRewards.sol) Contract logic.

## Features:

### For users:

1. Deposit your LP Tokens and claim a dynamic amount of ERC20 Tokens calculated as a share of the total rewards distributed per second. The users share of the rewards pool is proportional to their stake's share of total LP Tokens staked.
1. Withdraw your LP Tokens.
1. Claim rewards.
1. Withdraw all your LP Tokens and Claim Rewards in one transaction.

### For owner:

1. Distribute a fixed amount of ERC20 Tokens in a set period of time by LP Tokens Locking(Staking).
1. Set a fixed amount of ERC20 Tokens to be rewarded of a staking period.
1. Set multiple staking periods.


### Dev notes:

1. Getter functions designed to help with the UX/UI have been implemented in the contract to be able to get an amount of LP Tokens staked by each staker by passing a wallet address and the amount of ERC20 Tokens earned by the specified address.
